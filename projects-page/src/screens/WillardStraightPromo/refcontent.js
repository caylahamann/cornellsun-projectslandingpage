/** Make sure the order is consistent with each news article. For exmaple,
 *  The fifth array corresonds with the fifth news article. More articles can be
 *  added by adding a comma, and then adding another string. Make sure each
 * string in each array are all links. The links are displayed accordingly and its
 * string will be its own link. The number will appear next to its link like so:
 * [1] : https://www.hoover.org/research/day-cornell-died in the fifth news.
 * Link will open in external tab. Those with empty arrays will not have a
 * reference section at the end of the page.
