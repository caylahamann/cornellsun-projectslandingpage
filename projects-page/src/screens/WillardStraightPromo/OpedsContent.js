    p1: "ifty years ago I was an angry young man in my senior year at Cornell University. Mentally and emotionally I was prepared to be one of those African-Americans who would meet my destiny in a struggle against oppression and injustice that was much larger than any one of us, and even much larger than all of us. I thought we were the generation fingered by history to draw the line on America’s ill treatment of its black population. It had to stop with us, in our time.",
    p2: "As I reflect from the perspective of 50 years on the events at Cornell University in April 1969, I feel both regret and pride. I have regrets regarding the individual toll of those events. I’m sorry at the individual level of the people who were hurt. That includes black students who were traumatized; President Perkins who became the scapegoat for the wrath of angry trustees, faculty, and alumni; and professors and their families who were frightened by my angry rhetoric and the spectre of armed students on campus. But I’m not sorry at the institutional level, the broadest of which is the events at Cornell in the context of the racial discrimination and oppression and violence against African-Americans which was common in America at that time. I’m proud that we black students armed ourselves and said, in effect, “we are the generation of African-Americans who will not be intimidated by vigilantes”. The lesson here is that some life situations do not lend themselves to simplistic judgements of who was right or wrong. Sometimes it’s not either right or wrong, it’s both. I was right in April 1969 because our cause was just in fighting a racist society. But I was also wrong because my tactics caused harm to some individuals. I’ve wrestled my entire adult life with this moral ambiguity of April 1969 at Cornell University.",
    p3: "We should remember that 50 years ago America was still engaged in an unresolved battle to secure equal treatment for black Americans in public accommodations, employment, housing, voting, and other civil rights. De jure segregation was enshrined in the law in many states, and de facto institutional discrimination was the social norm throughout America. The petty discrimination of being denied access to public facilities was intended to dehumanize African-Americans, and to proclaim every day that we were different and inferior. The systemic institutional denial of economic opportunities ensured that African-Americans remained poor and powerless. Each previous decade of American history was more brutal in its treatment of the black population. That’s why I’m proud that my colleagues and I had the courage to say that the oppression and intimidation of African-Americans would stop with our generation, and we were prepared to fight about it.",
    p4: "The purpose of reciting this history is not just to remind us of where we have been, but also to focus on how far we have come. There is no point in suffocating our potential for today and tomorrow with irreconcilable animosity over the grievances of the past. The burden is too heavy, and we cannot change the past. That’s why I believe that just as a family cannot heal unless it lets go of yesterday’s anger, so all Americans of every race and creed and ethnicity should be open to reconciliation and healing, otherwise we will never achieve our full potential as a multiracial, multiethnic, and religiously diverse democracy.",
    p5: "Historical reflection also seems to make an undeniable case that African-Americans, other minorities, women, and the LGBTQ community have widespread educational, economic, and social opportunities today which are unprecedented in American history. Does this mean that America has overcome its historical problems? Of course not! The legacy of hundreds of years of slavery and the related physical and psychological barbarity against African-Americans created a scale of human misery and dysfunctionality which cannot be reversed or healed in just 50 years. But is America moving in the direction of civic equality and equal opportunity – unequivocally yes! This in no way diminishes the important work that Black Lives Matters and other groups do today to bring attention to ongoing police and vigilante violence against African-Americans, and widespread poverty among African-Americans. But we should acknowledge and celebrate the truth that for every incident of racial violence against African-Americans which occurs today, the frequency of such incidents was proportionately 50 times greater 50 years ago, and one 100 times greater one 100 years ago! We should acknowledge and celebrate the truth that many millions of African-Americans have lifted themselves out of poverty into the middle class and even higher. We should acknowledge and celebrate the truth that de jure discrimination against African-Americans is no longer enshrined in American law or the judicial system.",
    quote1: "You'd think about it a minute and go, \"huh.\" And that was pretty much the whole story.",
    p6: "So even as I am acutely aware of how far we have yet to go, I am enormously thankful for how far America has come in the past 50 years. I hope America continues this progress and becomes a country which respects and celebrates our diversity within the context of overarching bonds of community.",

    p44: "Thomas W. Jones ’69 was a spokesman for the Afro-American Society at the time of the Willard Straight Hall takeover. After graduating Cornell, he went on to serve as chairman and chief executive officer of Global Investment Management at Citigroup, president and chief operating officer of TIAA-CREF, and as a member of the Cornell Board of Trustees. He is the author of a memoir, From Willard Straight to Wall Street, published by Cornell University Press. "
