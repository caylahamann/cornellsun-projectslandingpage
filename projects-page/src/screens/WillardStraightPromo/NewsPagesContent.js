    p1: "oughly three months after the enactment of the landmark 1963 Civil Rights Act, a Princeton-educated academic began his tumultuous tenure as Cornell’s seventh university president. Until he resigned from his position six years later, President James A. Perkins presided over an increasingly racially-charged campus that struggled to accommodate the rapid influx of African American students.",
    p2: "In 1965, Perkins, a firm believer in racial integration, set up the Committee on Special Education Projects, a minority recruiting program that aspired to make Cornell accept more \“qualified students who have been disadvantaged by their cultural, economic and educational backgrounds.\” ",
    p3: "The committee’s recruiting efforts led to a dramatic rise in African American enrollment. When Perkins arrived on campus, Cornell had less than 20 African American students, mostly from middle class backgrounds, out of a student population of more than 4,000. By Fall 1968, the University had 250 African American Cornellians, many from Northern cities and the South. That was a 1250 percent increase.",
    p4: "Cornell struggled to respond to the sudden influx of people of color into campus. While fraternities created a special committee to help black students rush fraternities, the Phi Delta Theta fraternity in Fall 1966 charged some black students for entry into a party while letting their white classmates in for free. The campus store did not sell any makeup suitable for black women, or books and many other items used by African Americans.",
    p5: "Partially as a result of the insufficient accommodation for them, many African Americans felt like Cornell was trying to assimilate them into white culture at the expense of their black identity. \“I think they want us to get into this \‘mainstream\’ thing. They figure that after four years up here in this isolated world, you’ll go back and fall into your $20,000 a year job and never think twice,\” said Earl M. Armstrong \’69, then a successful biochemistry student.",
    quote1: "Many African Americans felt like Cornell was trying to assimilate them into white culture at the expense of their black identity.",
    p6: "In response to these and many other instances of racial friction, in 1966, some black students founded the Afro-American Society, a predominantly black group that stated it aimed to spread factual information about black history and fight \“social, economic and psychological conditions which blight the lives of black people.\” ",

    p8: "As the AAS rose in popularity, and more black students were admitted to Cornell, high-profile racial incidents became increasingly common in the one-year period leading up to the takeover.",
    p9: "In April 1968, roughly 50 AAS members took control of the economics department to protest a visiting lecturer, Father Michael McPhelin, who they said was perpetuating \“institutional racism.\” ",
    p10: "Phelin, who lectured about poverty in the United States, sometimes implied that the U.S. poor lacked the necessary drive and ambition to succeed.  While Phelin was not explicitly discussing poor blacks during his lectures, some of the African American students in the classroom argued that he implicitly was, motivating them to demand his removal and replacement by a black professor. ",
    p11: "The demands went unmet and the students soon vacated Goldwin Smith Hall, where the economics department was located then.",
    quote4: "The AAS published a statement in March 1969 denouncing the board for engaging in \“selective political intimidation.\”",
    p14: "Several high profile incidents will follow the economics department takeover. In December of that year, seven black students with toy guns caused commotion in the Ivy Room. Two months later in February 1969, in the middle of a symposium on South Africa, two students jumped on stage, one of who grabbed President Perkins\’ collar as he was beginning to explain why Cornell invested in the Apartheid country. One month after that, two white students assaulted on the Arts Quad said their assailants were black.",
    p15: "The toy guns incident in particular provoked Cornell to impose penalties on those involved. The disciplinary board at the time repeatedly summoned the students, who did not attend the hearings because they considered it illegitimate. The AAS had published a statement in March 1969 denouncing the board for engaging in \“selective political intimidation,\” failing to include black board members and wrongfully judging \“political acts directed against the University administration.\” ",
    p16: "The board made their decisions anyway at two a.m. on April 18, convicting three black students for physical harassment. The other defendants who escaped conviction were all white.",
    p17: "Less than an hour after the conviction of the three African American students, members of the Wari House — an off-campus cooperative established at the request of AAS to accommodate African American women — saw a cross burning on their front porch. ",
    p18: "The next day, black students moved into Willard Straight Hall.",
    p19: "Around 5:30 a.m. on April 19, about 100 black students began barricading the exits of Willard Straight Hall, which was hosting Parent’s Weekend guests. By 6:16 a.m., they had evicted all the parents and employees in the building under the coordination of the AAS.",
    p20: "The students assumed control of the building in a peaceful manner, according to Edward L. Whitfield ’70, then-president of AAS. ",
    p21: "\“We asked the janitors to sit down for awhile. We told them if they had any duties before they left the building, they should do them. Like if they had to call the police, they should call them. … They said, \‘Yes we do have to call the police, but we don’t want to do it because you all seem like a nice group of fellows\’,\” Whitfield later told a group of Cornell alumni.",

    p22: "s nearly 50 members of the Students for a Democratic Society, a prominent student organization involved in the civil rights movement with branches in many U.S. campuses, surrounded the Straight in solidarity, the University considered obtaining a court injunction to eject the occupants, telling them at 9:15 a.m. that they would be guilty of trespassing if the occupation continues. ",
    p23: "Twenty minutes later, 20 to 25 fraternity brothers, most from Delta Upsilon, entered the Straight from a broken window. Then DU President Thomas MacLeod \’70 said that the brothers entered the building because they \“just wanted to open lines of communication with the black athletes.\” The occupiers almost immediately pushed out the brothers from the building, but soon received reports that some fraternity members \“were discussing whether or not to attack us,\” according to Tom Jones \’69 M.A. \’72, a student leader involved in the takeover.",
    p24: "A trustee committee investigating the takeover later concluded that the occupiers had heard several threatening rumors while they held the Straight, including reports that there was a bomb in the building, someone was conspiring to burn the Wari house, and a group of drunk fraternity brothers were collecting arms to \“get back their building.\”",
    p25: "These concerns motivated the black students to receive firearms from their supporters outside during the evening of that day. In total, the students armed themselves with 17 rifles and shotguns, along with stashes of ammunition. While guns were not banned from campus at this point, the introduction of firearms to campus politics shocked President Perkins, who said that it was \“a shattering experience. The guns were not justified.\” ",
    p26: "The stalemate persisted into the next morning, when administrators met with an unarmed Whitfield and several other AAS representatives in the foyer of the Straight. There, black students said the University had to, among other demands, nullify its conviction of those involved in the toy gun incident and begin an investigation into the cross-burning at Wari House. The negotiation continued until 2 p.m. when Whitfield agreed to soon leave the building. The students later left with guns still in hand, despite Cornell’s requests to vacate the Straight unarmed.",
    p27: "At 4 p.m., April 20, the African American students, still equipped with bandoliers and firearms, left the Straight to cheering crowds. Steve Starr of The Associated Press photographed the dramatic exit of one of the students, AAS leader Eric Evans \’69, and received a Pulitzer prize for it.",
    p28: "As condition for the students\’ withdrawal from the building, the University agreed to investigate the cross burning and recommend the nullification of the toy gun incident convictions at a faculty meeting. It also agreed to help the students find legal help if they later faced civil charges, but declined to pay for it. In turn, African American students agreed to help build a new judiciary system that AAS would consider legitimate.",
    p29: "The campus controversy, however, was not over. 40 professors, mostly in the government and history departments, threatened to resign if the charges from the toy gun incident were nullified. It took an intervention from Perkins to have the faculty agree to rescind the reprimands. Several professors and administrators still resigned. ",
    p30: "While he initially signaled his intention to stay in office despite the incident, Perkins also resigned several weeks after the takeover as alumni and faculty criticized his handling of the occupation.",
    p31: "The events immediately following the occupation had significant effects on Cornell’s shared governance. An impromptu group composed of thousands of faculty members and students in Barton Hall began discussing a wide range of issues from racism to academic freedom. The group later helped reform the student judiciary system and set up Cornell’s first shared governance institution, the University Senate.",

      p2: "Starr originally got into photography in highschool when his school newspaper, where he served as editor, did not have a photographer. This translated into a life-long love of photographing moments and people, working full time as a college student for the local news paper, extending his undergraduate time to five years. The years paid off because Starr was immediately hired by the Associated Press, a national news organization — his dream.",
      p3: "After interning in the New York office for his first year, Starr was sent to Albany. Prior to the Willard Straight Hall takeover, he had seen many college campuses and their protests. The 1960s marked a tumultuous time in American history as young people protested the war in Vietnam, the ongoing Civil Rights Movement and increasing diversity on college campuses. ",
      p4: "\“Because I am young and available all the time, I was the photographer they sent to demonstrations. I had been to Yale, It seem[ed] like I was doing a demonstration every single month.\” ",

      p8: "He spent most of his time in the Cornell Public Relations office, learning information sparingly as they wished to share it as the situation escalated. However, once Starr was tipped that there were guns on campus, he was stunned. ",
      p9: "Starr likened the revelation to seeing spaceships — that was how unbelievable the notion was.",
      p10: "\“Our basic reaction was, you got to be kidding,\” Starr said. ",
      p11: "Once Starr saw one guy with a gun and was able to verify that a least a portion of the tip was true, he sprung into action. Unlike the other protests Starr had covered at the time, there was the introduction of the weapons.",
      quote4: "There had never been guns in a black protest.",
      p14: "\“To have guns on campus, had never happened at that point. There had never been guns in a black protest, it would run counter to the MLK non-violent narrative,\” Starr said. \“The reporter and I are very much aware of that and we are discounting the fact that there are guns. \“",
      p15: "On Sunday, the day the students finally left the building, Starr positioned himself and caught the first moments of students leaving the Straight. Immediately that night, Starr sent the photo through the A.P. wire service to news organizations across the country. A viral image was born. ",
      p16: "The widespread impact of the photo was in large part due to Starr’s affiliation with the Associated Press and the mechanism they had to share information. Similar photos taken of the situation did not get the same reaction. ",
      p17: "Starr believes the photos had such a great impact due to the incredulity of guns on campus for a protest.",
      p18: "\“My take is that to white America, the notion that blacks are going to fight back was an electrifying and terrifying moment,\” Starr said. \“You all add in the factor that these particular blacks folks are admitted to an elite Ivy League university — why the heck are they carrying guns and fighting back?\”",
      p19: "The social environment at the time largely shaped the public’s reaction to the image, Starr said.",
      p20: "\“There is this whole 1960 narrative that the country is coming unglued and there is violence and racial demonstrations everywhere,\” he recalled. \“At that particular time, the picture electrified the country.\”",

      p23: "Starr maintains, though, that the important part of the story are the people and the situation in the photograph, not the photographer.",
      p24: "\“I am the messenger, not the message,\” he said. \“It is a civil rights story, it is a black guy story.\”",

He told The Sun that he was conscious of the image he was creating and the actions he was taking. He purposefully was the last person leaving the building, carrying three levels of weapons, giving the image that he was ready to fight.",
      p28: "\“I was very conscious of the symbolism of the photo in the context of the Straight that caused us to bring in the guns. It was only after the vigilantes from Delta Upsilon that came into the Straight,\” Jones said. \“They were going to throw us out.\”",
      p29: "\“It was only then that we brought in the guns,\” Jones said. ",
      p30: "Jones said that black people had been terrorized by others for centuries. The statement he wanted to make was that there was a new generation of black people that would not be terrorized.",

      p1: `he Willard Straight Hall Occupation — described in 1999 by former professor Thomas Sowell as \“the day Cornell died\” — symbolized an era of national change and turmoil, full of questions about race. As the country turned their attention to the events unfolding in Ithaca in the following weeks, major news organizations often painted the event as violent and centered their narratives on the resulting white fear. `,
      p2: "Pictures of armed black students marching across campus plastered national newspapers, underscored by headlines about a violent crisis, likening the occupation to a battle in a war. However, when the black occupants initially entered the Straight, they were unarmed and no one was reported injured. ",
      p3: "On April 19, 1969, at 5:30 a.m., approximately 100 African-American students occupied Willard Straight Hall, ejecting 40 staff members and 30 Parents’ Weekend visitors by shouting “Fire!” The Sun previously reported. [2]",
      p4: "This occurred in the midst of one of the most racially difficult times on the Hill. In the fall of 1968, there were 250 black students on the campus of 14,000 — an increase from fewer than 20 in 1963. ",
      p5: "The occupation was largely a response to various racist incidents on campus that year. The Phi Delta Theta fraternity charged some black students to attend a dance without charging white students a fee. In response to an “intolerably hostile atmosphere of the dorms,”  the University created a black woman’s co-op, called Wari House. The day before the occupation, a flaming cross was found on their porch.",
      quote1: "When the black occupants initially entered the Straight, they were unarmed and no one was reported injured.",
      p6: "Though the occupants entered unarmed, they sought protection in the form of obtaining 17 rifles and shotguns from black students outside the Straight between 9:45 and 10 p.m. This came as a response to rumors that white fraternity brothers were planning to attack. Following the arming of the students, the University administration began negotiations, first over the phone with Edward Whitfield ’71.",

      quote2_1: "A news camera captures a speech given to the Barton Hall community. | Sun File Photo", 
      p7: "On April 20, 1969 at 4:13 p.m., the front doors of Willard Straight Hall opened. Students emerged after occupying the building for 35 hours. The 110 black students — some with ammunition strapped to their bodies and carrying rifles and shotguns — then marched through the Arts Quad to the AAS headquarters on North Campus to sign a seven-point agreement responding to the campus issues of race. ",
      p8: "This is where the Newsweek story began: at 4:13 p.m., after the first 35 hours of the occupation and the prior months of racial unrest. ",
      p9: "Further, the picture most associated with the event in nationwide publications was of the students exiting the building to sign. Taken by Associated Press photographer Steve Starr, the Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph was often paired with captions and headlines describing the students singularly as armed. ",
      p10: "The May 5, 1969 edition of Newsweek — a weekly magazine whose editions featured the prominent news stories of that week — offered the caption “Universities Under the Gun: Militants at Cornell” with that picture, on the cover.",
      p11: "\“Armed Negroes End Seizure, Cornell Yields,\” read The New York Times front-page article headline on April 21, 1969. ",
      quote4: "\“The Negro students left the litter of their occupation in Straight Hall.\”",
      p14: "The New York Times also focused on the physical aftermath of the event, despite the fact that the only injuries were minor, and a result of a fist-fight that broke out when white fraternity members attempted to break back in, before the guns arrived. ",
      p15: "“The Negro students left the litter of their occupation in Straight Hall,” it reported. “Mattresses and cushions had been pulled into the cafeteria where most of the students slept. In the Memorial Room, some high light fixtures had been ripped out, several candy machines had been rifled and walls bore slogans like ‘Kill the fraternity honkies’.”",
      p16: "The Newsweek article follows its description of the students “some draped with bandoliers and carrying an arsenal of seventeen rifles, shotguns and homemade spears” with the reaction from a white student. ",
      p17: "“When they stepped out and I saw the ammunition on the belts and the rifles, my heart dropped to my toes,” Lawrence Terkel, a white Cornell senior, said to Newsweek.",
      p18: "“This profound consternation was shared by almost everyone associated with Cornell — the faculty, the students, militant and uninvolved, parents and alumni,” Newsweek continued. “Moreover, it radiated beyond Cornell to every other U.S. campus and indeed beyond the universities to U.S. society as a whole.”",
      p19: "Ultimately, Newsweek glossed over the roots of the occupation in offering an explanation to why the black students armed, undermining the fear of attack by their white classmates. “Others, with a psychological bent, held that the blacks were mainly on a self-fueled ‘ego trip,’ and were asserting their masculinity — and no doubt there was some truth in that, as well,” it reported. ", 
      p20: "At least half of the occupants were women, though — a detail that escaped many major outlets’ reporting — according to Juanita Goss ’72, one of the participants.",
      p21: "Ultimately, the media response to the Willard Straight Hall occupation — its sentiment that the event was violent, catastrophic, and perhaps unnecessary — is summed by Newsweek. “The traumatic events at Cornell took place in a week when the U.S. campus seems to have turned into a national battleground.” ",

      p1: "gents of Change, the documentary released in 2016, focuses on two stories of student activism at San Francisco State University and Cornell University. The 1960s featured an era of protests reflective of the shifting times, including the civil rights movement and the Vietnam war. College campuses appeared ill-equipped to deal with the needs of rising black populations.",
      p2: "Frank Dawson ’72 and Abby Ginzberg ’71 co-directed and co-produced the movie, a documentary that details the development of the Willard Straight Hall Takeover.",
      p3: "Dawson and Ginzberg began working on the film in 2009. Dawson was a black freshman during the takeover inside Willard Straight Hall as events unfolded while Ginzberg was a white student outside the building as a member of Students for a Democratic Society. ",
      p4: "Dawson initially wanted to create a feature film in the 1980s, but was finally able to realize his goal in the 2000s. Ginzberg, on the other hand, had a career of making films of social justice issues and this topic was close to her and an important story to tell. ",
      p5: "The pair had not met prior to creating this documentary despite being on campus at the same time for three years and both playing a role in the takeover. According to Ginzberg, the two were introduced by a mutual friend after she expressed her interest to tell this story and Dawson wanted to do the same.",
      quote1: "Ginzberg [...] had a career of making films of social justice issues.",

      p7: "Although the partnership commenced in 2009, it took seven years to complete the film due to funding issues. According to Ginzberg, \“neither of [them] got paid,\” for their work on the film. ",
      p8: "One of the logistical problems in documenting the Cornell takeover was the lack of video footage according to Ginzberg. In contrast to the four TV stations in San Francisco covering the development of their campus events, Ithaca was very remote.",
      p9: "\“In Ithaca, there was no TV news station,\” Ginzberg told The Sun. \“Ithaca was a complete desert when it came to news.\”",
      p10: "Ginzberg and Dawson were reliant on the photos provided by Fenton Sands ’70, who was a prolific documentor of black student life at Cornell.",
      p11: "\“If it had not been for the photos taken by Fenton Sands, I do not know how we would have …  [had] any help in terms of photos to tell the Cornell story prior to the students taking over the Straight,\” Ginzberg said. \“His photos were [a] huge help in terms of documenting the story we are trying to tell.\”",
      quote4: "\“Ithaca was a complete desert when it came to news.\”",
      p14: "Ginzberg went to a diverse public high school in Manhattan. Going to Cornell was a culture shock for her with the decreased diversity. The lack of diversity at Cornell was one of the reasons she fought alongside the black students, she said. ",
      p15: "Additionally, the summer prior to the takeover, she saw first-hand as Columbia students fought against the university moving into Harlem in 1968. This also primed her for student activism.",
      p16: "Since she was a trusted and active member of SDS by the time the takeover occurred, Ginzberg was one of the white students who was called at 6 a.m. to help out. ",
      p17: "For Dawson, the takeover was \“a defining moment of [his] life.\”",
      p18: "\“I don’t think any of us going in to that building thought we were having a conversation about it 50 years later,\” Dawson said. \“I don’t know that we knew at that it would be recognized in the way that it was.\”",
      p19: "The Takeover was more than just a life-defining moment for Dawson, though, as it also helped shape his professional career. Through his participation he recognized the power that the media had and subsequently changed his focus to broadcasting and media.",
      p20: "At the time, a radio station operated out of Willard Straight Hall. During the Takeover, the radio waves were shut off, taking away the “voice” of students to speak directly, according to Dawson.",
      p21: "Additionally, Dawson’s mother called him during the Takeover, worried about what she had seen on the national news. Dawson said she did not believe what he was telling her. ",
      parallax2: agents2,
      parallax2_1: "Courtesy of Agents of Change",
      p22: "\“My mother did not believe her own son over someone she did not know, only because they were on television. That’s power,\” Dawson said.",
      p23: "Alumni have had strong reactions to the film. Dawson screened the film for the classes of 1972 and 1973, and he said many alumni were surprised to see  how the events went down. ",
      p24: "One alumnus shared with Dawson that they didn’t understand why black students \“kept to themselves\” and were so \“angry\” at the time, but now understood because of the film.",
      p25: "Since the film is about events that took place five decades ago, many people were hearing about this story for the first time. According to Ginzberg, they have been able to show the film at many different college campuses and it garnered different reactions as students shared struggles of their own.",
      p26: "At the University of Chicago, after seeing the film, students shared their experience with dining hall hours not being accessible to students on financial aid. Ginzberg recounted that many students said they would go hungry on the weekends, unable to afford meals not in dining halls.",
      p27: "At the historically black Spelman College, the women there were able to empathize with the fight the black students had over their education by drawing from their own experiences. At California State University, Bakersfield, students from the large Latinx population were fighting for a Chicanx studies program similar to black Cornell students’ fight for a black studies program. ",
      p28: "\“What students are suffering from are different,\” Ginzberg noted. \“At every school there was some issue.\”",
      p29: "For Dawson, one of the most powerful moments came from a screening of the film done at Broward County Community College. One student was moved to tears by the film, overwhelmed with emotion by the hard work students went through to institute black studies programs, according to Dawson.",
      p30: "\“Our goal with this film is to have it inform all students, particularly at Cornell but at all universities, that there was a really empowered students movement that led to all [these] changes,\” Ginzberg said.",

      p3: "Richardson was first inspired to create the course in 2010, when she attended a panel for the 40th anniversary of the Takeover. The panel featured Prof. Emeritus James Turner, African and African-American politics and social policy, and Gloria Joseph, assistant dean at the time of the Takeover. ",

[The Willard Straight Takeover] really put pressure on Cornell to live up to its highest ideals. It has continued relevance because the moment mirrored protests in so many other instances across the country. The lack of inclusion some felt here really paralleled the marginality and exclusion that some have experienced in the United States itself,” Richardson said. ",

      p1: "Though 50 years have passed since black students occupied Willard Straight Hall to protest unjust treatment on campus, Cornellians today are still impacted by what resulted from the takeover — a system of shared governance and a student-involved judicial system.",
      p2: "Before 1969, students had little to no say in campus governance. Members of the faculty were the sole decision-makers in academic and non-academic decisions until 1955 when the Board of Trustees gave the President the responsibility of non-academic decisions but continued to exclude students.",
      p3: "Though student government technically existed at Cornell prior to 1969, it had very limited or only symbolic power. Just 10 months prior to the takeover, the Cornell Students Association abolished itself, leaving Cornell without any form of student government at all.",
      p4: "However, in the days following the takeover, thousands of students and administrators met in Barton Hall to discuss racism on campus. The meetings lasted several days and eventually the conversation turned to discussions about student representation in University governance.",
      p5: "This brought about the creation of the Constituent Assembly, a 367-member assembly made up of students, faculty and administrators, whose sole purpose was to \“investigate and make recommendations for the redistribution of power,\” The Sun reported in 1969.",

      p9: "Until 1977, the Senate, made up of 132 members including 60 students, had unprecedented power on campus. It dictated the budgets for housing, dining, athletics and student life departments, for example. Any budgetary changes over $3,000 had to be approved by the Senate.  ",
      p10: "A 1981 editorial in The Sun called the University Senate \“one of the most progressive and powerful campus governments in the country,\” because of its vast legislative responsibilities.",

      p14: "1971 also saw the first four student trustees on the Board of Trustees, after the Constituent Assembly proposed the addition of students, faculty and employees to the board at the same time that it proposed the creation of the Senate. Cornell remains the only Ivy League school that allows students to serve as voting members of its board.",
      p15: "The number of student trustees later decreased to two after the board downsized from 62 to 42 in 1981. Today, two student trustees — one undergraduate and one graduate — are elected by the student body in alternating years. ",
      p16: "Though the Senate had power throughout the 1970’s, it was replaced with the Campus Council by the Board of Trustees in 1977. The Council, whose primary job was to advise the administration, was made up of 16 members — seven students, seven faculty and two employees.",
      p17: "Records from this era demonstrate a general discontent with the Campus Council, which lacked the power the Senate once had. The Sun editorial said the council had \“about as much impact as a goose-feather on the decision-process.\”",

The Graduate and Professional Student Assembly later split from the S.A. in 1993. ",
