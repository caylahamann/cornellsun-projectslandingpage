    p1: "oughly three months after the enactment of the landmark 1963 Civil Rights Act, a Princeton-educated academic began his tumultuous tenure as Cornell’s seventh university president. Until he resigned from his position six years later, President James A. Perkins presided over an increasingly racially-charged campus that struggled to accommodate the rapid influx of African American students.",
    p2: "In 1965, Perkins, a firm believer in racial integration, set up the Committee on Special Education Projects, a minority recruiting program that aspired to make Cornell accept more \“qualified students who have been disadvantaged by their cultural, economic and educational backgrounds.\” ",
    p3: "The committee’s recruiting efforts led to a dramatic rise in African American enrollment. When Perkins arrived on campus, Cornell had less than 20 African American students, mostly from middle class backgrounds, out of a student population of more than 4,000. By Fall 1968, the University had 250 African American Cornellians, many from Northern cities and the South. That was a 1250 percent increase.",
    p4: "Cornell struggled to respond to the sudden influx of people of color into campus. While fraternities created a special committee to help black students rush fraternities, the Phi Delta Theta fraternity in Fall 1966 charged some black students for entry into a party while letting their white classmates in for free. The campus store did not sell any makeup suitable for black women, or books and many other items used by African Americans.",
    p5: "Partially as a result of the insufficient accommodation for them, many African Americans felt like Cornell was trying to assimilate them into white culture at the expense of their black identity. \“I think they want us to get into this \‘mainstream\’ thing. They figure that after four years up here in this isolated world, you’ll go back and fall into your $20,000 a year job and never think twice,\” said Earl M. Armstrong \’69, then a successful biochemistry student.",
    quote1: "Many African Americans felt like Cornell was trying to assimilate them into white culture at the expense of their black identity.",
    p6: "In response to these and many other instances of racial friction, in 1966, some black students founded the Afro-American Society, a predominantly black group that stated it aimed to spread factual information about black history and fight \“social, economic and psychological conditions which blight the lives of black people.\” ",

    p7: "The group initially attracted only a small following. But two years later, many more black Cornellians became convinced that the University was not fostering a racially equitable campus that accommodated their needs, joining AAS in troves.",

    quote3_1: "After the failed incursion, the black occupiers made the decision to smuggle in guns for protection. They are seen here assembling in the main lobby prior to exiting the building. Courtesy of Fenton Sands ’70",
    p8: "As the AAS rose in popularity, and more black students were admitted to Cornell, high-profile racial incidents became increasingly common in the one-year period leading up to the takeover.",
    p9: "In April 1968, roughly 50 AAS members took control of the economics department to protest a visiting lecturer, Father Michael McPhelin, who they said was perpetuating \“institutional racism.\” ",
    p10: "Phelin, who lectured about poverty in the United States, sometimes implied that the U.S. poor lacked the necessary drive and ambition to succeed.  While Phelin was not explicitly discussing poor blacks during his lectures, some of the African American students in the classroom argued that he implicitly was, motivating them to demand his removal and replacement by a black professor. ",
    p11: "The demands went unmet and the students soon vacated Goldwin Smith Hall, where the economics department was located then.",
    quote4: "The AAS published a statement in March 1969 denouncing the board for engaging in \“selective political intimidation.\”",
    p14: "Several high profile incidents will follow the economics department takeover. In December of that year, seven black students with toy guns caused commotion in the Ivy Room. Two months later in February 1969, in the middle of a symposium on South Africa, two students jumped on stage, one of who grabbed President Perkins\’ collar as he was beginning to explain why Cornell invested in the Apartheid country. One month after that, two white students assaulted on the Arts Quad said their assailants were black.",
    p15: "The toy guns incident in particular provoked Cornell to impose penalties on those involved. The disciplinary board at the time repeatedly summoned the students, who did not attend the hearings because they considered it illegitimate. The AAS had published a statement in March 1969 denouncing the board for engaging in \“selective political intimidation,\” failing to include black board members and wrongfully judging \“political acts directed against the University administration.\” ",
    p16: "The board made their decisions anyway at two a.m. on April 18, convicting three black students for physical harassment. The other defendants who escaped conviction were all white.",
    p17: "Less than an hour after the conviction of the three African American students, members of the Wari House — an off-campus cooperative established at the request of AAS to accommodate African American women — saw a cross burning on their front porch. ",
    p18: "The next day, black students moved into Willard Straight Hall.",
    p19: "Around 5:30 a.m. on April 19, about 100 black students began barricading the exits of Willard Straight Hall, which was hosting Parent’s Weekend guests. By 6:16 a.m., they had evicted all the parents and employees in the building under the coordination of the AAS.",
    p20: "The students assumed control of the building in a peaceful manner, according to Edward L. Whitfield ’70, then-president of AAS. ",
    p21: "\“We asked the janitors to sit down for awhile. We told them if they had any duties before they left the building, they should do them. Like if they had to call the police, they should call them. … They said, \‘Yes we do have to call the police, but we don’t want to do it because you all seem like a nice group of fellows\’,\” Whitfield later told a group of Cornell alumni.",

    large_letter5: "A",
    p22: "s nearly 50 members of the Students for a Democratic Society, a prominent student organization involved in the civil rights movement with branches in many U.S. campuses, surrounded the Straight in solidarity, the University considered obtaining a court injunction to eject the occupants, telling them at 9:15 a.m. that they would be guilty of trespassing if the occupation continues. ",
    p23: "Twenty minutes later, 20 to 25 fraternity brothers, most from Delta Upsilon, entered the Straight from a broken window. Then DU President Thomas MacLeod \’70 said that the brothers entered the building because they \“just wanted to open lines of communication with the black athletes.\” The occupiers almost immediately pushed out the brothers from the building, but soon received reports that some fraternity members \“were discussing whether or not to attack us,\” according to Tom Jones \’69 M.A. \’72, a student leader involved in the takeover.",
    p24: "A trustee committee investigating the takeover later concluded that the occupiers had heard several threatening rumors while they held the Straight, including reports that there was a bomb in the building, someone was conspiring to burn the Wari house, and a group of drunk fraternity brothers were collecting arms to \“get back their building.\”",
    p25: "These concerns motivated the black students to receive firearms from their supporters outside during the evening of that day. In total, the students armed themselves with 17 rifles and shotguns, along with stashes of ammunition. While guns were not banned from campus at this point, the introduction of firearms to campus politics shocked President Perkins, who said that it was \“a shattering experience. The guns were not justified.\” ",
    p26: "The stalemate persisted into the next morning, when administrators met with an unarmed Whitfield and several other AAS representatives in the foyer of the Straight. There, black students said the University had to, among other demands, nullify its conviction of those involved in the toy gun incident and begin an investigation into the cross-burning at Wari House. The negotiation continued until 2 p.m. when Whitfield agreed to soon leave the building. The students later left with guns still in hand, despite Cornell’s requests to vacate the Straight unarmed.",
    p27: "At 4 p.m., April 20, the African American students, still equipped with bandoliers and firearms, left the Straight to cheering crowds. Steve Starr of The Associated Press photographed the dramatic exit of one of the students, AAS leader Eric Evans \’69, and received a Pulitzer prize for it.",
    p28: "As condition for the students\’ withdrawal from the building, the University agreed to investigate the cross burning and recommend the nullification of the toy gun incident convictions at a faculty meeting. It also agreed to help the students find legal help if they later faced civil charges, but declined to pay for it. In turn, African American students agreed to help build a new judiciary system that AAS would consider legitimate.",
    p29: "The campus controversy, however, was not over. 40 professors, mostly in the government and history departments, threatened to resign if the charges from the toy gun incident were nullified. It took an intervention from Perkins to have the faculty agree to rescind the reprimands. Several professors and administrators still resigned. ",
    p30: "While he initially signaled his intention to stay in office despite the incident, Perkins also resigned several weeks after the takeover as alumni and faculty criticized his handling of the occupation.",
    p31: "The events immediately following the occupation had significant effects on Cornell’s shared governance. An impromptu group composed of thousands of faculty members and students in Barton Hall began discussing a wide range of issues from racism to academic freedom. The group later helped reform the student judiciary system and set up Cornell’s first shared governance institution, the University Senate.",

      p1: "n April of 1969, Steve Starr was a young photojournalist working out of the Associated Press\’s Albany office. He had graduated from college in San Diego, spending his later school years working as a full-time photographer at the local newspaper. ",
      p2: "Starr originally got into photography in highschool when his school newspaper, where he served as editor, did not have a photographer. This translated into a life-long love of photographing moments and people, working full time as a college student for the local news paper, extending his undergraduate time to five years. The years paid off because Starr was immediately hired by the Associated Press, a national news organization — his dream.",
      p3: "After interning in the New York office for his first year, Starr was sent to Albany. Prior to the Willard Straight Hall takeover, he had seen many college campuses and their protests. The 1960s marked a tumultuous time in American history as young people protested the war in Vietnam, the ongoing Civil Rights Movement and increasing diversity on college campuses. ",
      p4: "\“Because I am young and available all the time, I was the photographer they sent to demonstrations. I had been to Yale, It seem[ed] like I was doing a demonstration every single month.\” ",
      p5: "Students pushing back against the administration was not foreign to Starr.",
      quote1: "Starr was immediately hired by the Associated Press.",
      p6: "\“You really have to live into 1968 and 1969. In 1968, Martin Luther had been assassinated, Bobby Kennedy is assassinated, this crazy guy Nixon is elected… It’s almost hard to explain,\” he said.",

      quote2_1: "The Newsweek cover featuring the Pulitzer-winning photograph by Steve Starr.",
      p7: "On the morning of the Takeover, Starr got a call notifying him to get to Ithaca — immediately. He heard there was a protest going on at Cornell.",
      // image2: behind2,
      // quote3_1: "The photographer as a young man. | Courtesy of Steve Starr",
      p8: "He spent most of his time in the Cornell Public Relations office, learning information sparingly as they wished to share it as the situation escalated. However, once Starr was tipped that there were guns on campus, he was stunned. ",
      p9: "Starr likened the revelation to seeing spaceships — that was how unbelievable the notion was.",
      p10: "\“Our basic reaction was, you got to be kidding,\” Starr said. ",
      p11: "Once Starr saw one guy with a gun and was able to verify that a least a portion of the tip was true, he sprung into action. Unlike the other protests Starr had covered at the time, there was the introduction of the weapons.",
      quote4: "There had never been guns in a black protest.",
      p14: "\“To have guns on campus, had never happened at that point. There had never been guns in a black protest, it would run counter to the MLK non-violent narrative,\” Starr said. \“The reporter and I are very much aware of that and we are discounting the fact that there are guns. \“",
      p15: "On Sunday, the day the students finally left the building, Starr positioned himself and caught the first moments of students leaving the Straight. Immediately that night, Starr sent the photo through the A.P. wire service to news organizations across the country. A viral image was born. ",
      p16: "The widespread impact of the photo was in large part due to Starr’s affiliation with the Associated Press and the mechanism they had to share information. Similar photos taken of the situation did not get the same reaction. ",
      p17: "Starr believes the photos had such a great impact due to the incredulity of guns on campus for a protest.",
      p18: "\“My take is that to white America, the notion that blacks are going to fight back was an electrifying and terrifying moment,\” Starr said. \“You all add in the factor that these particular blacks folks are admitted to an elite Ivy League university — why the heck are they carrying guns and fighting back?\”",
      p19: "The social environment at the time largely shaped the public’s reaction to the image, Starr said.",
      p20: "\“There is this whole 1960 narrative that the country is coming unglued and there is violence and racial demonstrations everywhere,\” he recalled. \“At that particular time, the picture electrified the country.\”",
      p21: "Fortunately for Cornell’s situation, the students and the administration worked to deescalate the situation before it led to bloodshed. ",

      parallax2_2: " | Courtesy of Steve Starr",
      p22: "On the day Starr received his Pulitzer for the award-winning photograph a year after the takeover, four students were murdered at Kent State during the Vietnam War protests. Kent State was a reminder of what Cornell could have been.",
      p23: "Starr maintains, though, that the important part of the story are the people and the situation in the photograph, not the photographer.",
      p24: "\“I am the messenger, not the message,\” he said. \“It is a civil rights story, it is a black guy story.\”",
      p25: "As Starr reflected on his career and the takeover, he addressed — and lamented — the current state of journalism. ",
      p26: "\“How in the world you are going to report the news? Visual journalist[s] are going to have an influence in this radically changed environment where everybody in the world can take a picture and video, newspapers are contested as fake [and] newspapers are dying?\” Starr asked. ",
      p27: "Tom Jones \‘69 a black student who participated in the takeover, is the subject of the photo where he is raising his fist in a black power salute. He told The Sun that he was conscious of the image he was creating and the actions he was taking. He purposefully was the last person leaving the building, carrying three levels of weapons, giving the image that he was ready to fight.",
      p28: "\“I was very conscious of the symbolism of the photo in the context of the Straight that caused us to bring in the guns. It was only after the vigilantes from Delta Upsilon that came into the Straight,\” Jones said. \“They were going to throw us out.\”",
      p29: "\“It was only then that we brought in the guns,\” Jones said. ",
      p30: "Jones said that black people had been terrorized by others for centuries. The statement he wanted to make was that there was a new generation of black people that would not be terrorized.",
      p31: "\“The black power salute, we are the generation of African Americans that is not going to be intimidated,\” Jones stated. \”That’s what I was feeling, and that's how I looked in the photo — they captured it perfectly.\”",
